WIP - this python script should process the system com.miui.notes (v7.x) data backup file
and recover your notes from the bitstream file as Markdown files

as a goal, this should preserve all formatting and note data, including embedded files

---

working alternative until i finish this parser: a way to transfer over your notes
from your phone app to Markdown format is to sync your notes to Mi Cloud, and use the 
Minote Sync community plugin for Obsidian notes, it is tested and works.
